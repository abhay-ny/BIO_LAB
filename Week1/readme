Genetic Algorithm for Optimization Problems:
Genetic Algorithms (GA) are inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics, where the fittest
individuals are selected for reproduction to produce the next generation. GAs are widely used for solving
optimization and search problems. Implement a Genetic Algorithm using Python to solve a basic optimization
problem, such as finding the maximum value of a mathematical function.
Implementation Steps:
1. Define the Problem: Create a mathematical function to optimize.
2. Initialize Parameters: Set the population size, mutation rate, crossover rate, and number of generations.
3. Create Initial Population: Generate an initial population of potential solutions.
4. Evaluate Fitness: Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population.
5. Selection: Select individuals based on their fitness to reproduce.
6. Crossover: Perform crossover between selected individuals to produce offspring.
7. Mutation: Apply mutation to the offspring to maintain genetic diversity.
8. Iteration: Repeat the evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation processes for a fixed number of
generations or until convergence criteria are met.
9. Output the Best Solution: Track and output the best solution found during the generations.
