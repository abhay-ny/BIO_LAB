Optimization via Gene Expression Algorithms:
Gene Expression Algorithms (GEA) are inspired by the biological process of gene expression in
living organisms. This process involves the translation of genetic information encoded in DNA
into functional proteins. In GEA, solutions to optimization problems are encoded in a manner
similar to genetic sequences. The algorithm evolves these solutions through selection,
crossover, mutation, and gene expression to find optimal or near-optimal solutions. GEA is
effective for solving complex optimization problems in various domains, including engineering,
data analysis, and machine learning.
Implementation Steps:
  1. Define the Problem: Create a mathematical function to optimize.
  2. Initialize Parameters: Set the population size, number of genes, mutation rate, crossover
    rate, and number of generations.
  3. Initialize Population: Generate an initial population of random genetic sequences.
  4. Evaluate Fitness: Evaluate the fitness of each genetic sequence based on the optimization
    function.
  5. Selection: Select genetic sequences based on their fitness for reproduction.
  6. Crossover: Perform crossover between selected sequences to produce offspring.
  7. Mutation: Apply mutation to the offspring to introduce variability.
  8. Gene Expression: Translate genetic sequences into functional solutions.
  9. Iterate: Repeat the selection, crossover, mutation, and gene expression processes for a
    fixed number of generations or until convergence criteria are met.
  10. Output the Best Solution: Track and output the best solution found during the iterations.
