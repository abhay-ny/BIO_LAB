Particle Swarm Optimization for Function Optimization:
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking or fish
schooling. PSO is used to find optimal solutions by iteratively improving a candidate solution
with regard to a given measure of quality. Implement the PSO algorithm using Python to
optimize a mathematical function.
Implementation Steps:
  1. Define the Problem: Create a mathematical function to optimize.
  2. Initialize Parameters: Set the number of particles, inertia weight, cognitive and social
    coefficients.
  3. Initialize Particles: Generate an initial population of particles with random positions and
    velocities.
  4. Evaluate Fitness: Evaluate the fitness of each particle based on the optimization function.
  5. Update Velocities and Positions: Update the velocity and position of each particle based on
    its own best position and the global best position.
  6. Iterate: Repeat the evaluation, updating, and position adjustment for a fixed number of
    iterations or until convergence criteria are met.
  7. Output the Best Solution: Track and output the best solution found during the iterations.
