Ant Colony Optimization for the Traveling Salesman Problem:
The foraging behavior of ants has inspired the development of optimization algorithms that
can solve complex problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Ant Colony
Optimization (ACO) simulates the way ants find the shortest path between food sources and
their nest. Implement the ACO algorithm using Python to solve the TSP, where the objective is
to find the shortest possible route that visits a list of cities and returns to the origin city.
Implementation Steps:
  1. Define the Problem: Create a set of cities with their coordinates.
  2. Initialize Parameters: Set the number of ants, the importance of pheromone (alpha), the
    importance of heuristic information (beta), the evaporation rate (rho), and the initial
    pheromone value.
  3. Construct Solutions: Each ant constructs a solution by probabilistically choosing the next
    city based on pheromone trails and heuristic information.
  4. Update Pheromones: After all ants have constructed their solutions, update the
    pheromone trails based on the quality of the solutions found.
  5. Iterate: Repeat the construction and updating process for a fixed number of iterations or
    until convergence criteria are met.
  6. Output the Best Solution: Keep track of and output the best solution found during the
    iterations.
