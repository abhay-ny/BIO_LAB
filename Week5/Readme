Cuckoo Search (CS):
Cuckoo Search (CS) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the brood parasitism
of some cuckoo species. This behavior involves laying eggs in the nests of other birds, leading
to the optimization of survival strategies. CS uses Lévy flights to generate new solutions,
promoting global search capabilities and avoiding local minima. The algorithm is widely used
for solving continuous optimization problems and has applications in various domains,
including engineering design, machine learning, and data mining.
Implementation Steps:
  1. Define the Problem: Create a mathematical function to optimize.
  2. Initialize Parameters: Set the number of nests, the probability of discovery, and the number
    of iterations.
  3. Initialize Population: Generate an initial population of nests with random positions.
  4. Evaluate Fitness: Evaluate the fitness of each nest based on the optimization function.
  5. Generate New Solutions: Create new solutions via Lévy flights.
  6. Abandon Worst Nests: Abandon a fraction of the worst nests and replace them with new
    random positions.
  7. Iterate: Repeat the evaluation, updating, and replacement process for a fixed number of
    iterations or until convergence criteria are met.
  8. Output the Best Solution: Track and output the best solution found during the iterations.
