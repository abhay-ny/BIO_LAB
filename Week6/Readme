Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO):
The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm is a swarm intelligence algorithm inspired by the
social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves. It mimics the leadership structure of
alpha, beta, delta, and omega wolves and their collaborative hunting strategies. The GWO
algorithm uses these social hierarchies to model the optimization process, where the alpha
wolves guide the search process while beta and delta wolves assist in refining the search
direction. This algorithm is effective for continuous optimization problems and has
applications in engineering, data analysis, and machine learning.
Implementation Steps:
  1. Define the Problem: Create a mathematical function to optimize.
  2. Initialize Parameters: Set the number of wolves and the number of iterations.
  3. Initialize Population: Generate an initial population of wolves with random positions.
  4. Evaluate Fitness: Evaluate the fitness of each wolf based on the optimization function.
  5. Update Positions: Update the positions of the wolves based on the positions of alpha, beta,
    and delta wolves.
  6. Iterate: Repeat the evaluation and position updating process for a fixed number of iterations
    or until convergence criteria are met.
  7. Output the Best Solution: Track and output the best solution found during the iterations
